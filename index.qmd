This is the AMAR (All Minorities at Risk) webpage. 
AMAR is an independent continuation of the Minorities at Risk (MAR) data that Ted Gurr began collecting in the 1980s about the political trajectories of minorities engaging the state worldwide.

On this page you can find links to publications outlining the structure and purpose of the AMAR data.  There are also links to the data produced in the project and a link to the site of the original MAR (Minorities at Risk) data.

Please note that we are are working on a more user friendly interface for downloading and working with the data and we also are in the process of updating the data so please be patient and check back frequently.
